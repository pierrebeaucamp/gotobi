As this application has a couple of subpackages we need to set a special ``GOPATH``. This repository needs to be in ``src/github.com/pierrebeaucamp/gotobi`` and ``GOPATH`` needs to be set to the directoy which contains ``src/github.com/...``

Additionally, set the following environment varibale for the database: 
````
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://bekbgxsvrltnpf:6P1if_k6f62pH-N59epi3DI7b_@ec2-54-83-205-164.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d1q5mcrji9rk5j
````
